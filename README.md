Guessing Game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Hello! My name is Carson Parker and this is my guessing game.

Project name: Guessing Game
My game is 6 questions, ranging from "Where did I grow up?", to "How old am I?"
The game tracks how many questions out of 6 you get correct and then tells you the correct answers to each question. Also, in the console, it shows the user what answer was given to each question, both for the yes/no questions and the guessing a number questions. I hope you have fun taking my first quiz!

Here is what is included in my project:
-The index.html file, which contains all of my html work.
-the java-review.js file, which contains all of my JavaScript work.
